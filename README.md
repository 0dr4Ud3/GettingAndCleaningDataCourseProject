# GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject
Peer-graded assingment for the Getting and Cleaning data course

#### README file

List of attached files:

- ***run_analysis.R***: R script where the raw data was treated in order to obtain a final tidy data set. All the instructions are adequately commented with understandable explanations. Briefly, the instructions were the following: 

  1. Unzipping the downloaded file and setting the working directory
  2. Reading raw data files for both the test dataset and the training dataset, and additional files (activity_labels.txt and features.txt)
  3. Assign descriptive names to the variables
  4. Merge datasets
  5. Select the mean and standard deviation of the measured variables
  6. Generate a new tidy dataset with the computed mean for each variable and save it in a txt file: "tidydata.txt".


- ***README.md***: the present markdown file with a relation of files generated in the analysis

- ***CodeBook.md***: markdown file with a brief summary of the study and the relation of variables to be found in the tidy dataset.

- ***tidydata.txt***: tidy dataset in a txt file with the computed mean for each variable per individual and activity.
